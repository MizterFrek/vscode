## Pro edition 💎

In this documentation and when using the extension, you will see some features marked with a diamond 💎. It means they are only available in the Pro edition.

While this extension is very popular, with 1 million installations, it is *not* a tool developed by the Angular team or affiliated to Google in any way.

It is months of *unpaid* work by a single contributor.

So feel free to enjoy advanced features and support a contributor at the same time! 💖

⚡️ To celebrate 1 million installations, the Pro edition is currently 50% off for a limited time.
